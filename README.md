# Chatter
A configurable XXXXX (not sure what to call it) based on a project the navy had for testing data flow in and out of systems
<br>
I have been wanting to do this for awhile. At the turn of the century I was asked to build a linux server and scripts that could be used to simulate a realword environment. I built 4 of these and was able to create traffic accross simulates secure networks.
<br>I see this as an XML configurable system which should be able to simulate a busy mail server, a denial of service attack, random usage of FTP, SSH, etc....
